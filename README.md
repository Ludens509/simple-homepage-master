# **SBA 307: HTML and CSS**

Version 1.0, 03/31/2023  
---

**Introduction**

This test has a total duration of **three (3) days**. This is a **take-home assessment**. 

Your instructor will designate at least half a day for you to work on this assessment in class. If you need more time, you have three additional days (including weekends and holidays) to work on your assessment. This assessment will be due at **5:00 PM** on the third day after it was assigned to your cohort.

# **Objectives**

This SBA will test your skills in creating a simple website with a clean layout and styling. Your website should have a well-developed HTML structure and follow good visual design methodologies in order to produce a satisfying user experience.

# **Scenario and Instructions**

In this Skill-based Assessment, you will be creating a small three-page website. The topic and content of your website is entirely up to you – be creative\! 

Your work will be graded based on the technical requirements listed in the following section. Creativity always works in your favor, so feel free to go beyond the scope of the listed requirements if you have time.

Since this is likely your first time creating a website, keep it simple. Keeping it simple ensures that you can complete this project within the given time. Like most projects you’ll encounter, you should finish the absolute requirements first, and *then* add complexity if you have time. This also gives you a better idea of what you can get done in the given time if you were to do it again with more requirements.

Once you have your website idea, approach your design with the user’s perspective in mind. User experience is one of the most important aspects of good web design. If users enjoy their time on your site, they are more likely to trust whatever services or information you offer, and more likely to come back and visit again.

For this project, don’t worry too much about the content of the site. There are many places you can find free content to display on your site, as listed below. Concentrate more on the website's structure and grid system.

**Resources for free content:**

* **Text:** [Lipsum](https://www.lipsum.com/), a Lorem Ipsum text generator.  
* **Images:** [Pexels](https://www.pexels.com/), a resource for stock photos (and other media)  
* **GIFs:** [Motion Elements](https://www.motionelements.com/search/gif), a resource GIFs (and other media)

**Technical Requirements**

The requirements listed below are **absolute minimums**. Ensure that your website meets these requirements before attempting to further expand your features.

**HTML Requirements**

* Have at least **three pages**.  
  * Keep the grid system consistent between pages as much as possible.  
* Use at least **ten different HTML tags**.  
* Include at least **one table**.  
* Include at least **two forms**.  
* Include at least **one dropdown menu**.  
* Include at least **one of each** of the following forms of content:   
  * Text.  
  * Images.  
  * GIFs.  
  * (See resource links above for some free content of each of these types.)

**CSS Requirements**

* Make use of **inline, internal, and external styling**.  
* Use **five different CSS selectors**.  
* Use colors that complement each other.  
  * [Coolors](https://coolors.co/palettes/trending) is one of many resources that can help you find a color palette.  
* Use **Flexbox** and/or the **Bootstrap Grid**.  
* Use at least **two CSS animations**.

**Deliverables**

When you have completed your website, submit the following:

* Your completed project in a ZIP file, which should include all HTML files and any external CSS files. 

  * Include a README file that includes technical specifications and a description of your website.

  * Upload this ZIP file to Canvas.

* A GitHub link to your project’s repository.

  * Include the link to your GitHub account in your README file.

  * Upload the GitHub link to this project to Canvas.

# **Reflection (optional)**

Once you have completed your project, answer the following questions to help solidify your understanding of the process and its outcomes.

1. *What could you have done differently during the planning stages of your project to make the execution easier?*

| *I could have span more time on refining and adding comment on my code for future reference.* |
| :---- |

   2. *Were there any requirements that were difficult to implement? What do you think would make them easier to implement in future projects?*

| *There wasn’t any requirement that was difficult to implement. To make it easier to implement the features they could have given a wireframe in forth, we can skip the thinking about what we can come up with as design.* |
| :---- |

      3. *What would you add to or change about your website if given more time?*

| *IF i had more time i would have implement a dark mode functionality in my project Add a button at the top top to toggle between light and dark mode. And also make my menu bar fully responsive with a burger hamburger icon. And add more animation for aesthetics.* |
| :---- |

      4. *Use this space to make notes for your future self about anything that you think is important to remember about this process, or that may aid you when attempting something similar again.*
